# Hi, I'm Manaal!!!! 👋

### I am currently pursuing my MSc in Health Technologies & Data Science, and I have a clinical background with a BSc in Medical Imaging (Diagnostic Radiography)

I'm a developer and researcher focused on the intersection of Health Technologies, Data Science, and Medical Imaging. My goal is to apply robust computational models (Python, R) to solve complex problems in diagnostics and patient compliance, with a strong interest in the MedTech sector.

### 🌟 Featured Project: Halal-Fit Chef Agent
I participated in the *Kaggle Agents Intensive - Capstone Project*, and my project is an example of applying complex Multi-Agent Systems to solve real-world, compliance-driven problems:
* Goal: Generate nutritionally optimized, Indian-cuisine meal plans while strictly validating Halal compliance in parallel.
* Architecture: Demonstrates a professional Sequential $\rightarrow$ Parallel $\rightarrow$ Sequential agent flow.
* Concepts: Features Custom Tools (macro calculation), Long Term Memory, and Observability.
